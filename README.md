**A Transformational Opportunity **  

---

## **Introduction: Partnering in the Mission of the Kingdom**

This proposal outlines an opportunity for you to partner in an innovative program that aligns with the teachings of Jesus and the mission of the Kingdom of God. By embracing the principles of sowing and reaping, this initiative empowers participants to experience financial freedom, deepen their faith, and transform communities.

At the core of this program is the power of generosity. Participants sow a one-time donation of **$1,222**, reaping **90% of subsequent donations** generated through their affiliate links. This model not only fosters financial independence but also drives Kingdom-focused initiatives that restore families, communities, and dreams.

## **Program Overview: The Generosity Model**

### **How It Works**
1. **$1,222 Initial Donation**  
   Participants commit to a one-time donation, symbolizing faith in God's provision and a desire to invest in Kingdom-building efforts.  

2. **90% Reaping**  
   - Participants earn 90% of every subsequent $1,222 donation made through their unique affiliate link.  
   - This creates a system of financial freedom, breaking the cycle of the "daily grind" and empowering individuals to focus on their God-given callings.  

3. **10% Kingdom Allocation**  
   - **9% for the Kingdom Mission ("Son of Man" Belief System)**: Dedicated to advancing a vision rooted in the teachings of Jesus to:  
     - Restore families to love and purpose.  
     - Reduce poverty and isolation.  
     - Create thriving, Spirit-filled communities where dreams are reignited and lives are transformed.  

   - **1% for Cody Haskins**: As the co-creator with God of this initiative, I, Cody Haskins, will steward this portion to ensure the continued growth, refinement, and impact of this program.

## **Biblical Foundation for Generosity and Impact**

This initiative is grounded in the teachings of Jesus and the principles of the Kingdom of God:  
- **"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed... Though it is the smallest of all seeds, when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches."** *(Matthew 13:31-32)*  

- **"Freely you have received; freely give."** *(Matthew 10:8)*  

- **"The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."** *(Matthew 20:28)*  

This program invites participants to embody these teachings by sowing generously and reaping abundantly, all while serving as co-laborers in advancing the Kingdom of God.
