      <h1>ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program Proposal</h1>
    <h2>A Transformational Opportunity</h2>

    <h3>Introduction: Partnering in the Mission of the Kingdom</h3>
    <p>
        This proposal outlines an opportunity for you to partner in an innovative program that aligns with the teachings of Jesus and the mission of the Kingdom of God. By embracing the principles of sowing and reaping, this initiative empowers participants to experience financial freedom, deepen their faith, and transform communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the core of this program is the power of generosity. Participants sow a one-time donation of <strong>$1,222</strong>, reaping <strong>90% of subsequent donations</strong> generated through their affiliate links. This model not only fosters financial independence but also drives Kingdom-focused initiatives that restore families, communities, and dreams.
    </p>
    <h2>Program Overview: The Generosity Model</h2>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>$1,222 Initial Donation:</strong> Participants commit to a one-time donation, symbolizing faith in God's provision and a desire to invest in Kingdom-building efforts.</li>
        <li><strong>90% Reaping:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Participants earn 90% of every subsequent $1,222 donation made through their unique affiliate link.</li>
                <li>This creates a system of financial freedom, breaking the cycle of the "daily grind" and empowering individuals to focus on their God-given callings.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>10% Kingdom Allocation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>9% for the Kingdom Mission ("Son of Man" Belief System):</strong> Dedicated to advancing a vision rooted in the teachings of Jesus to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Restore families to love and purpose.</li>
                        <li>Reduce poverty and isolation.</li>
                        <li>Create thriving, Spirit-filled communities where dreams are reignited and lives are transformed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>1% for Cody Haskins:</strong> As the co-creator with God of this initiative, I, Cody Haskins, will steward this portion to ensure the continued growth and refinement, to make a global impact with Holy Spirit-empowered generosity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>PMA - Private Membership Association</h2>
    <p>
        ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program is structured under a <strong>Private Membership Association (PMA)</strong>. This means that the program operates as a private entity that is legally distinct from public systems and outside the jurisdiction of certain governmental regulations. By joining, you agree to abide by the program's internal rules and guidelines, which are aligned with Kingdom principles of generosity, stewardship, and abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PMA protects the rights of members by providing a framework that allows for voluntary membership and participation. The benefits of being part of this program are outlined in the membership guidelines, and members are encouraged to share their experiences and testimonies in a spirit of unity and empowerment.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of the PMA, all donations and contributions are voluntary and are governed by ABBA, our Father in Heaven, and the co-creators of this Holy Spirit inspired vision. The program ensures that all resources are allocated according to the principles of sowing and reaping, with a focus on supporting the Kingdom mission and furthering the work of Jesus Christ through financial freedom and empowerment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your participation in ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program is your declaration of faith in the Kingdom's principles of generosity, multiplication, and the spreading of the love of Jesus. By contributing, you become part of a movement that seeks to impact both believers and non-believers alike, providing opportunities for financial independence and spiritual transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that as a member, you are part of a private association and your involvement is protected as long as you follow the guidelines of the program. There is <strong>no termination clause</strong>, and your membership remains intact as long as you continue to engage this program through your affiliate membership account.
    </p>
    <h2>Impact of the 90% Donation Reaping Model</h2>
    <h3>Breaking Free from the Workweek Grind</h3>
    <p>
        Participants who engage in the program experience a shift from the toil of earning money through time-bound labor to financial freedom rooted in Kingdom principles. By sowing into this program:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial Freedom:</strong> The 90% reaping allows participants to create passive income streams, enabling them to:
            <ul>
                <li>Spend more time with family.</li>
                <li>Invest in their spiritual growth.</li>
                <li>Pursue God’s calling for their lives.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Community Empowerment:</strong> With increased financial resources, participants can:
            <ul>
                <li>Support local ministries and outreach programs.</li>
                <li>Become conduits of generosity in their communities.</li>
                <li>Establish businesses or initiatives that align with Kingdom values.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Community Transformation through the Kingdom Mission</h3>
    <p>The <strong>9% allocation</strong> for the "Son of Man" belief system fuels participating churches to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Restore Families:</strong> Provide counseling and support to families in crisis. Offer resources to strengthen marriages and parent-child relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce Poverty:</strong> Fund skills training and small business creation. Support programs that address root causes of poverty.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Thriving Communities:</strong> Establish centers for mentorship, education, and spiritual growth. Build networks of Spirit-filled believers who serve as light and salt in their communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Inspire Dreams and Freedom:</strong> Empower individuals to pursue their God-given visions without financial constraints. Break the chains of hopelessness and inspire confidence in God's provision.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Biblical Foundation for Generosity and Impact</h2>
    <p>This initiative is grounded in the expressed image of Jesus and the principles of the Kingdom of God:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed... Though it is the smallest of all seeds, when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches." (<strong>Matthew 13:31-32</strong>)</li>
        <li>"Freely you have received; freely give." (<strong>Matthew 10:8</strong>)</li>
        <li>"The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." (<strong>Matthew 20:28</strong>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Projected Reach and Community Impact</h2>
    <h3>Christian Population</h3>
    <p>Just 1 of the targeted Demographics: ~500 million Christians across the U.S. and Europe. Reaching 0.5% (2.5 million individuals) at $1,222 generates $3 billion in donations.</p>

    <h3>Affiliate Model</h3>
    <p>Participants sharing their affiliate links with just 30 people generate:</p>
    <p><strong>30 x $1,222 x 90% = $32,994 per participant.</strong></p>
    <p>This revenue empowers individuals to reinvest in their communities, ministries, and dreams. Matthew 13:23 “Now the one sown on the good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands. He indeed bears fruit, yielding a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty times what was sown.”</p>

    <h3>Community Impact Breakdown</h3>
    <p>$3 billion raised through 0.5% of the demographic:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>$2.7 billion (90%) distributed to participants.</li>
        <li>$270 million (9%) fuels Kingdom mission projects.</li>
        <li>$30 million (1%) supports Holy Spirit generosity stewardship and expansion.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scalability and Growth Strategy</h2>
    <p>ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program is designed to grow exponentially, expanding as new members join and participate in the affiliate system. The key growth elements include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Referral System:</strong> A powerful, Holy Spirit-driven referral model where members invite others to join, sharing the message of Jesus and empowering each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Incentives for Growth:</strong> Spirit-led incentives will be given to individuals who actively expand their network, with bonuses based on Holy Spirit-led generosity, as the reach grows the co-creators desire to pay off houses, cars, college tuition, back child support, etc...</li>
        <li><strong>Building Partnerships:</strong> Partnerships with churches and Kingdom-focused organizations will increase awareness and promote active participation.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Outreach:</strong> Expanding the reach of the program internationally, allowing individuals in countries around the world to be part of the Kingdom mission.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>No Termination of Membership</h2>
    <p>
        As part of our commitment to empowering you, there is <strong>no termination of membership</strong> in ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program. Once you join, you will always have access to the program and its benefits, regardless of financial challenges or life circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you encounter struggles, we will help you through the community we are building. Holy Spirit-led incentives will be offered to help you reach financial goals and generate passive income to make this program an investment in your future. The goal is for everyone to experience an abundant life and realize their dreams as part of God's Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only safeguard we have is to ensure that communications within the program remain aligned with our core mission: to spread the love of Jesus. Any messages or actions contrary to this will be blocked to maintain the integrity of the program.
