        <h1>ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program Proposal</h1>
        <h2>A Transformational Opportunity</h2>

        <h3>Introduction: Partnering in the Mission of the Kingdom</h3>
        <p>
            This proposal outlines an opportunity for you to partner in an innovative program that aligns with the teachings of Jesus and the mission of the Kingdom of God. By embracing the principles of sowing and reaping, this initiative empowers participants to experience financial freedom, deepen their faith, and transform communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the heart of this program is the power of generosity. Participants sow a one-time donation of <strong>$1,222</strong>, reaping <strong>90% of subsequent donations</strong> generated through their affiliate links. This model not only fosters financial independence but also drives Kingdom-focused initiatives that restore families, communities, and dreams.
        </p>
        <h2>Acts 2:42 Initiatives: Apostles’ Doctrine of Love</h2>
        <p>
            This program is an expression of the apostles’ doctrine of love described in Acts 2:42. It focuses on creating a Spirit-filled community where participants are devoted to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Teaching:</strong> Immersing themselves in the foundational truths of Jesus’ life, death, resurrection, and promise of the Holy Spirit.</li>
            <li><strong>Fellowship:</strong> Building strong, Spirit-led relationships that encourage faith and generosity.</li>
            <li><strong>Breaking Bread:</strong> Sharing resources and stories of transformation that celebrate the abundance of ABBA's Kingdom.</li>
            <li><strong>Prayer:</strong> Committing to intercede for one another and seeking the leading of the Holy Spirit in all things.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As Jesus declared in John 16:7, "It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you." This promise of the Holy Spirit is at the core of this program, guiding every aspect of its operation and empowering participants to walk in Kingdom abundance.
        </p>
        <h2>Program Overview: The Generosity Model</h2>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>$1,222 Initial Donation:</strong> Participants commit to a one-time donation, symbolizing faith in God's provision and a desire to invest in Kingdom-building efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>90% Reaping:</strong>

                    <li>Participants earn 90% of every subsequent $1,222 donation made through their unique affiliate link.</li>
                    <li>This creates a system of financial freedom, breaking the cycle of the "daily grind" and empowering individuals to focus on their God-given callings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>10% Kingdom Allocation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>9% for the Kingdom Mission ("Son of Man" Belief System):</strong> Dedicated to advancing a vision rooted in the teachings of Jesus to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Restore families to love and purpose.</li>
                            <li>Reduce poverty and isolation.</li>
                            <li>Create thriving, Spirit-filled communities where dreams are reignited and lives are transformed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1% for Cody Haskins:</strong> As the co-creator with God of this initiative, I, Cody Haskins, will steward this portion to ensure the continued growth and refinement, making a global impact with Holy Spirit-empowered generosity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
      <!-- Part 2 -->
    <h2>Acts 2:42 Initiatives: Living the Apostles' Doctrine of Love</h2>
    <p>
        ABBA’s Kingdom Donation Program is deeply rooted in the vision of Acts 2:42, where the early believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, fellowship, the breaking of bread, and prayer. This initiative embodies the love and promise of ABBA, who declared through Jesus that His departure was for our benefit so that we might receive the Holy Spirit. It is through this promise that believers experience the fullness of life, love, and restoration in the Kingdom of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Acts 2:42 Initiatives focus on bringing the Kingdom to earth as it is in Heaven by fostering environments where participants can immerse themselves in ABBA's love and the teachings of Jesus. These initiatives include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Apostles’ Doctrine of Love:</strong> Teaching the foundations of Jesus' message—love, repentance, forgiveness, and reconciliation with the Father. Participants will have access to resources, mentorship, and interactive gatherings designed to deepen their understanding of ABBA’s love.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fellowship and Community:</strong> Building Spirit-led communities where believers and non-believers can experience ABBA's love. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Regular Zoom meetings to share testimonies, encouragement, and teachings.</li>
                <li>In-person gatherings to foster relationships and spiritual growth.</li>
                <li>A private online platform for continuous connection, mentorship, and sharing of resources.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Breaking of Bread:</strong> Sharing meals and resources as an expression of unity and love. Special events will be organized to commemorate the Lord’s Supper and celebrate the faithfulness of ABBA in providing for His children.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prayer and Intercession:</strong> Developing a culture of prayer that aligns with the Holy Spirit’s leading. Dedicated prayer teams will intercede for participants, their families, and the global Kingdom mission.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rejoicing in the Holy Spirit Promise</h3>
    <p>
        Jesus declared in John 16:7, “But I tell you the truth: it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.” The Acts 2:42 Initiatives call participants to rejoice in this promise, living daily in the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. This initiative will emphasize:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Teaching participants to hear and follow the voice of the Holy Spirit.</li>
        <li>Equipping believers to operate in spiritual gifts for the edification of the Body of Christ.</li>
        <li>Providing practical tools to live a life that reflects the love, joy, peace, and power of the Kingdom.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Empowerment Through Love and Generosity</h2>
    <p>
        The Acts 2:42 Initiatives also incorporate programs that equip participants to embrace the love of ABBA and extend it to others. These programs are designed to break the chains of poverty, foster self-sustaining communities, and reduce reliance on external systems by enabling the Body of Christ to meet its own needs. Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Financial Education:</strong> Workshops and resources to help participants steward their finances according to Kingdom principles. Topics include budgeting, debt elimination, and investing in the Kingdom.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Outreach and Service Projects:</strong> Opportunities to serve the homeless, support orphans and widows, and restore communities through acts of generosity and love.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Adoption and Family Support:</strong> Assisting families in adopting children, strengthening marriages, and providing resources to support family growth and restoration.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dream Building:</strong> Helping participants rediscover and pursue God-given dreams, including starting businesses, funding education, and fulfilling lifelong callings.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Testimonies: The Fruit of the Kingdom Mission</h2>
    <p>
        The power of ABBA's love and the promise of the Holy Spirit are transforming lives through this program. Testimonies from participants reveal the profound impact of the Kingdom mission:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A single mother testifies how the 90% reaping model allowed her to leave her job, spend more time with her children, and pursue her calling in ministry.</li>
        <li>A young entrepreneur shares how the program provided the financial freedom needed to start a Kingdom-focused business that employs and ministers to the homeless.</li>
        <li>A pastor describes how the Acts 2:42 Initiatives have revitalized his church, creating a culture of love, generosity, and unity among members.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These testimonies are just the beginning of the abundant fruit that the Kingdom mission will bear as participants continue to live out the apostles’ doctrine of love, empowered by the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
      <!-- Part 3 -->
    <h2>ABBA’s Kingdom Storehouse: A Vision of Overflow</h2>
    <p>
        The vision of ABBA’s Kingdom Donation Program is to create a storehouse of abundance that reveals God’s provision and generosity. This storehouse is a tangible expression of the Kingdom, where believers and non-believers alike experience the transformative power of Jesus’ love. As Malachi 3:10 declares, “Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.”
    </p>
    <h3>The Wealth Transfer and Kingdom Multiplication</h3>
    <p>
        The program is aligned with the prophetic promise of wealth transfer to God’s children for the advancement of His Kingdom. This wealth transfer is not for personal gain but for the multiplication of the Kingdom mission, breaking chains of poverty, and establishing self-sustaining communities. Participants are invited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Sow Generously:</strong> Embrace the principle of sowing and reaping, trusting ABBA to provide for every need and multiply resources for His glory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reap Abundantly:</strong> Experience the overflow of blessings as the program’s 90% reaping model empowers participants to build financial freedom, support their families, and invest in Kingdom purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Share in the Abundance:</strong> Extend generosity to others, creating a ripple effect of love and provision that reflects the heart of ABBA.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Impact of 1,000 Donors in Phase 1</h3>
    <p>
        Phase 1 of the program aims to reach 1,000 donors, each contributing $1,222. This foundational phase will establish the groundwork for the Acts 2:42 Initiatives, the Kingdom storehouse, and the program’s global reach. The impact of these 1,000 donors will be profound, breaking the chains of poverty for countless families and children of ABBA. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine the power of this collective act of generosity:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Children receiving education and care through Kingdom-funded initiatives.</li>
        <li>Communities transformed by self-sustaining businesses and outreach projects.</li>
        <li>Families restored and empowered to walk in the fullness of God’s love.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is not just a financial goal—it is a Kingdom mission, revealing the heart of ABBA and the power of His love to restore, redeem, and renew.
    </p>
    <h2>The Private Membership Association (PMA)</h2>
    <p>
        Participation in ABBA’s Kingdom Donation Program is structured as a Private Membership Association (PMA), ensuring that every member is part of a protected and purpose-driven community. The PMA reflects the values of Jesus’ Kingdom and upholds the following principles:

        </li>
