        <h1>Proposal for Partnership: Advancing the Kingdom of God Through Generosity</h1>
        <h2>A Transformational Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
            This proposal outlines an opportunity for you to partner in an innovative program that aligns with the teachings of Jesus and the mission of the Kingdom of God. By embracing the principles of sowing and reaping, this initiative empowers participants to experience financial freedom, deepen their faith, and transform communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the core of this program is the power of generosity. Participants sow a one-time donation of $1,222, reaping 90% of subsequent donations generated through their affiliate links. This model not only fosters financial independence but also drives Kingdom-focused initiatives that restore families, communities, and dreams.
        </p>

        <h2>Program Overview: The Generosity Model</h2>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>$1,222 Initial Donation:</strong> Participants commit to a one-time donation, symbolizing faith in God's provision and a desire to invest in Kingdom-building efforts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>90% Reaping:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants earn 90% of every subsequent $1,222 donation made through their unique affiliate link.</li>
                    <li>This creates a system of financial freedom, breaking the cycle of the "daily grind" and empowering individuals to focus on their God-given callings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>10% Kingdom Allocation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>9% for the Kingdom Mission ("Son of Man" Belief System):</strong> Dedicated to advancing a vision rooted in the teachings of Jesus to:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Restore families to love and purpose.</li>
                        <li>Reduce poverty and isolation.</li>
                        <li>Create thriving, Spirit-filled communities where dreams are reignited and lives are transformed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>1% for Cody Haskins:</strong> As the co-creator with God of this initiative, I, Cody Haskins, will steward this portion to ensure the continued growth and refinement, to make a global impact with Holy Spirit empowered generosity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact of the 90% Donation Reaping Model</h2>
        <h3>Breaking Free from the Workweek Grind</h3>
        <p>Participants who engage in the program experience a shift from the toil of earning money through time-bound labor to financial freedom rooted in Kingdom principles. By sowing into this program:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Freedom:</strong> The 90% reaping allows participants to create passive income streams, enabling them to:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Spend more time with family.</li>
                <li>Invest in their spiritual growth.</li>
                <li>Pursue God’s calling for their lives.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Community Empowerment:</strong> With increased financial resources, participants can:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Support local ministries and outreach programs.</li>
                <li>Become conduits of generosity in their communities.</li>
                <li>Establish businesses or initiatives that align with Kingdom values.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Call to Action: Partner with Us to Advance the Kingdom</h2>
        <p>NOW, this is your opportunity to join a movement that aligns with Jesus’ mission to proclaim the gospel, restore lives, and bring freedom. Together, we can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Empower your friends, family, and community to live out Kingdom principles of giving and reaping.</li>
            <li>Transform communities by addressing poverty, restoring families, and inspiring dreams.</li>
            <li>Expand God’s Kingdom through sustainable generosity and faith-driven initiatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>"The Kingdom of God is at hand." (Mark 1:15)</strong></p>
        <p>Will you partner with us to sow into the vision of Jesus and reap a harvest that brings life, freedom, and transformation to the world?</p>
